# NEVER AUTO-PUSH TO GITHUB
# This file serves as a reminder to never automatically push changes
# User must explicitly authorize pushes with specific command

REMINDER:
- Do NOT use git push automatically
- Always ask user before pushing
- Use "git status" to show changes
- Use "git add" and "git commit" to prepare changes
- WAIT for user approval before "git push"
